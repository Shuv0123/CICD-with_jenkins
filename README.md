# CICD-with_jenkins
## What is Continuous integration (CI) Continuous Delivery (CD) and Continuous Deployment (CDE)?

- CI/CD is a method used to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development. It is considered the backbone of DevOps practices and automation.

## Continuous integration (CI)
- Continuous integration (CI) is practice that involves developers making small changes and checks to their code. Developers merge code to main branch multiple times a day and there is an automated build and test process which gives instant feedback.
    - faster software builds
    - customer satisfaction by deploying on time
    - small code changes make fault isolation simpler and quicker
    - improve software build

## Continuous Delivery (CD)
- Continuous delivery (CD) is an extension of continuous integration. It makes sure you can release new changes to your customers quickly as it automates the release process so you can deploy the application at any time by just clicking a button. In continuous Delivery the deployment is completed manually.

## Continuous Deployment (CDE)
- CDE we go one step further than continuous delivery by deploying to our customers after every development change. There is no human intervention in CDE, unlike continuous delivery, no button has to be pressed to deploy the application. Only a failed test will prevent a new change being deployed to production.

## CD VS CDE
- Continuous integration forms a part of both continuous delivery and continuous deployment.

- In continuous delivery the deployment is done manually and in continuous deployment it happens automatically.

## What is Jenkins? 

- Jenkins is an open source automation server. It helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery.

## .pub and private keys (SSH keys) SET-UP
- Open GitBash as an admin
- cd .ssh
- Enter ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your GitHub Email"
   - The following prompt "Enter a file in which to save the key (/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa):" Enter file name
   - No passphrase - hit enter
- Access the public key - "cat eng110_shuvo.pub" -and copy the key
- Go on GitHub and click on your profile 
- Scroll down to settings 
- On the left CLick on SSH and GPG keys
- Press on new SSH key paste the content of your eng110_shuvo.pub file

## Connect GitHub repository to Jenkins
- Open GitBash as an admin
- cd .ssh
- Enter ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your GitHub Email"
   - The following prompt "Enter a file in which to save the key (/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa):" Enter file name
   - No passphrase - hit enter
- Go to github repository
- Click on 'Settings'
   - 'Deploy key'
   - 'Add key'
   - Paste the private key
- On Jenkins, create a build.
- Tick Discard old builds. Max # of builds to keep = 3.
- GitHub project - use the http link NOT ssh.
- Tick restrict where this project can be run.
- For Label Expression, type in sparta-ubuntu-node (might need to press backspace and fiddle around with it until it recognises the label).
- For Source Code Management, choose Git.
For Repository URL, choose the repository's SSH link.
Run this command on the private key generated: clip < ~/.ssh/eng110_cicd_sam.
Credientials: add a new key.
Choose SSH Keys. Give it the same name as your private key (for example eng110_cicd_sam).
Paste the private key's contents into the box.
Make sure it is */main and not */master
Tick Provide Node & npm bin/ folder to PATH
Go to build - execute shell
Type in these commands - make sure the path to your app folder is right:
cd app
npm instal
npm test
